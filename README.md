# TRY Creative Tech - Swipe challenge by Raivis Kārkliņš

## Disclamer: There are two main files

### App.js
- App.js is made pixel perfect from the provided Figma Design (https://www.figma.com/file/DvWcUJGtjcjmu6rCw3zZf4/Coding-Challenge).
- It works for 2 resolutions - 1440 × 1024px and 375 × 824px.
- To alter between these resolutions open up Google Chrome, press F12, press CTRL + SHIFT + M and at the top of the screen, select Dimensions to be Responsive and type in these resolutions.
### AppResponsive.js
- AppResponsive.js is not pixel perfect, but it is responsive from 375 to 2560px width.
- It is based on the provided Figma Design.
- It was made to showcase my ability to provide media queries.
### You can view both by editing the index.js file line #9, by changing the component.
